												<h3>Summary</h3>
											</header>
<p>Throughout my academic career, I have been offered many experiences that have contributed to my growth as an engineer. Through the PLTW academy, I have been able to network with various entrepreneurs in the engineering field and I've been given the opportunity to go to the Tri-Valley Manufacturing Day where I was able to meet people working on material production. Along with this, at the event, I was able to learn about patenting and research development. I was fortunate enough to attend Workday in which we learned much about the various backgrounds of different employees. </p>	
<p>One may think a big tech company will have mainly people with degrees in engineering, however, after attending we realized that as long as you have the necessary skills for the position you can receive the position. It was also amazing to know that some languages(Swift and Java) that I am proficient in are being used day to day in major companies. </p>		
<p>In my engineering courses, we had guest speakers come in explaining their occupation and how they decided to enter their field.  However, having met electrical engineers from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories I have been able to gain a better understanding of what it means to be an electrical engineer. I was able to learn a lot about programs they use ranging from VHDL to system Verilog. I've learned to love engineering and continued learning some Arduino through UC Berkeley's Eta Kappa Nu. It's so fun and interesting that I've self-taught myself Java. </p>
<p>After serving as a Lab assistant and seeing how different groups interact and test differently has opened my mind to all the possibilities we can learn. Throughout all my experiences, I've learned so many technical skills and I found a love for researching, learning, and developing.</p>
