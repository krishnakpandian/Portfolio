												<h3>Python Hangman Game</h3>

											<p>This is a side project I've been working on for fun. While I was trying to learn Java, I decided to relearn python and I made this gaming hangman for fun. The game is still a little buggy, I learned a lot about syntax during this project and it's something I'm still trying to learn and improve on.</p>

												<h3>Random Number Generator</h3>

											<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/projectimg/rng.JPG" alt="" /></a>
											<p>This was another side project I worked on that my teacher recommended me to work. I really enjoyed soldering during my PCB project that I decided to solder in many components to build a Random Number Generator. It was mostly for fun and I got it generating number based on values 0-9. I also found out that random number generators aren't completely random.</p>

										<p>This is my most recent project I've worked with a team of engineers. This was for the annual entrepreneurship competetion at our local high school. During the 2 previous years my team made it to the final round without winning an award.
										This year with so much determination and perserverence, we developed a product that would end our losing competition streak. This year we developed a series line of products that focused on improving access and ability to charge items. 
										We developed the power pop, power table, and power pants. Each of these products emphasize wireless charging in a safe and efficient way. I worked on modeling the power pants in my team and we decided to use a wireless charger in an extra pcoket and run 
										wiring through the inseams of the pants protected by a layer of chlorinated polyethylene to protect the wiring from damage in the washing machine. We also added a flexible solar panel such that users would be able to charge their phones while 
										walking outside. We were able to fully complete the model with one issue being that we purchased the wrong amperage solar panel so we had issues with the sun generating enough power. However, after using a power source in replacement of the solar panel 
										we were able to get it to produce power for a charger. We also developed the circuitry and models of what would be a table that could safely charge multiple items safely and a portable solar charger. This year was one of my most successful years with my team 
										ending as a finalist. We also found it funny that apple came out with the similar product as the power table a little bit after the competition with there model being a mat. I'm so proud of the work I've done this project as I embraced learning the 
										circuit design of a wireless charger while also using my skills in chemistry and business to develop a cost efficient solution within a team. If my team and I weren't going to different universities we would continue pursuing this model and we would continue testing 
										till we made a sustainable option for society.</p>

									<h3>Message Board</h3>
								</header>
								<p>For our breadboarding assignment we were asked to make our breadboard to display a message within 4 different states. Being a group of seniors we embraced our high school slogan "Stay Fly Dublin High". During this project, I did a majority of the breadboarding as I really enjoy breadboarding and we completed with an additional counter to help cycle through each state automatically.</p>

									<h3>Hydrogen/Solar Car</h3>
								</header>
								<p>For our engineering class, we competed to build the most efficient vehicle. However, the catch was it had to be the most efficient average between both hydrogen cells and solar cells. I learned a lot about mechanics during this project working with an experienced mechanic student and we were able to win 2nd among all the classes.</p>

									<h3>Printed Circuit Board</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This was an individual project that each person was supposed to create a PCB. I decided to develop a low battery indicator and this project has taught me so much about the designing and modeling of many circuity boards. It's a very tedious and difficult project, however I thoroughly enjoyed building and soldering this even though my model didn't work.</p>

									<h3>MIT App Inventor</h3>

								<p>This was the first time I worked on app development. My partner and I modified and improved an application currently on the MIT app inventor demo store. I learned sequential programming and what it means to be a pair programmer as this was my first team engineering project.</p>

									<h3>SnapSafe</h3>
								</header>
								<p>For our annual final competition, my team and I competed to develop the best entrepreneurial product. We decided to build a car security system using products sponsored by GE, swift, and python. Specifically in this project, I focused on developing the python code for the rasberry pi and we had so much potential to develop a full product. However, we struggled to implement the ios application alongside our working security sensor. We were able to make it to the final competition and definitely with a little more time we feel like we could have won.</p>

									<h3>Machine Control Feedback</h3>
								</header>
								<p>In this team project we were required to build a machine that used robot feedback mechanism to solve a problem for a manufacturing company. We developed an air ventilation system using Vex and coding in RobotC. This project was my first glimpse in C programming and understanding how machines interact with society.</p>
