												<h3>Entrepreneurship Comp. 2018</h3>
											</header>
											<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qC3zUJn5RLLbvV-N_e7RdmvxtnH-WsqBT5qI63cDy4I/edit#heading=h.ikd6asfkh3bw" class="image featured"><img src="images/projectimg/untether.png" alt="" target ="_blank"/></a>
											<p>This is a side project that me and a group of friends of mine tasked ourselves with. For the 2018 entrepreneurship competition we wanted to build a viable product with a functioning model. We built solar charging pants that worked as a proof of concept but I was so proud of this project for it getting to the final round of the school entrepreneurship competition.</p>

												<h3>Random Number Generator</h3>
											</header>
											<a href="" class="image featured"><img src="images/projectimg/rng.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<p>This was another side project I worked on that my teacher recommended me to work. I really enjoyed soldering during my PCB project that I decided to solder in many components to build a Random Number Generator. It was mostly for fun and I got it generating number based on values 0-9. I also found out that random number generators aren't completely random.</p>

										<p>This is my most recent project I've worked with a team of other programmers. This was for a hackathon called CruzHacks at UC Santa Cruz. This was my second hackathon at this point and I was still learning some of the fundamentals of coding. 
										For this competition, my team and I wanted to code an Amazon Alexa just because it seemed like an interesting product to work with. We wanted to make something with Alexa that would emphasize communicating to you versus a feedback response.
										Our initial product idea was to use an accelerometer and connect it with Alexa so it would be able to detect and send notifications of an earthquake. After extensive research and having the Amazon Alexa judge tell us that this product would be 
										impossible. It was disheartening to hear the impossibility of our idea but he also mentioned how it's impossible to send notifications to itself. My team and I knew that he was wrong about that after finding API's online. We decided to restructure our 
										product to be a notification system in case a relative was in an accident. We had Alexa compile information from USGS to check for fire information and compared with a database of contacts to see if an friend/relative was near a fire and it would notify you.
										We got our product working and used an earthquake simulator to represent damage and created a working proof of concept. During this project, I learned a lot of JSON and started working with databases with website development. It was an extremely fun project to work on 
										and I'm learning more about JSON mainly because of this project. I was really proud of my team for getting 2nd place in the Amazon Alexa category overall.</p>

									<h3>Message Board</h3>
								</header>
								<p>For our breadboarding assignment we were asked to make our breadboard to display a message within 4 different states. Being a group of seniors we embraced our high school slogan "Stay Fly Dublin High". During this project, I did a majority of the breadboarding as I really enjoy breadboarding and we completed with an additional counter to help cycle through each state automatically.</p>

									<h3>Hydrogen/Solar Car</h3>
								</header>
								<p>For our engineering class, we competed to build the most efficient vehicle. However, the catch was it had to be the most efficient average between both hydrogen cells and solar cells. I learned a lot about mechanics during this project working with an experienced mechanic student and we were able to win 2nd among all the classes.</p>

									<h3>Printed Circuit Board</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This was an individual project that each person was supposed to create a PCB. I decided to develop a low battery indicator and this project has taught me so much about the designing and modeling of many circuity boards. It's a very tedious and difficult project, however I thoroughly enjoyed building and soldering this even though my model didn't work.</p>

									<h3>MIT App Inventor</h3>

								<p>This was the first time I worked on app development. My partner and I modified and improved an application currently on the MIT app inventor demo store. I learned sequential programming and what it means to be a pair programmer as this was my first team engineering project.</p>

									<h3>SnapSafe</h3>
								</header>
								<p>For our annual final competition, my team and I competed to develop the best entrepreneurial product. We decided to build a car security system using products sponsored by GE, swift, and python. Specifically in this project, I focused on developing the python code for the raspberry pi and we had so much potential to develop a full product. However, we struggled to implement the IOS application alongside our working security sensor. We were able to make it to the final competition and definitely with a little more time we feel like we could have won.</p>

									<h3>Machine Control Feedback</h3>
								</header>
								<p>In this team project we were required to build a machine that used robot feedback mechanism to solve a problem for a manufacturing company. We developed an air ventilation system using Vex and coding in RobotC. This project was my first glimpse in C programming and understanding how machines interact with society.</p>
